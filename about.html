                        <h3>Welcome to my Journey!</h3>
                        <p>My name is Spencer Rose. I'm from Clearwater, Florida
                                and a current
                                student-athlete at Tufts University. At Tufts,
                                I'm double-majoring in Computer
                                Science (BS) and Economics (BA) and will
                                graduate this upcoming Spring.
                                My interests include hockey and finance, both of
                                which I am deeply passionate
                                about.

                        <p>One goal of my website is to demonstrate
                                how economics and computer
                                science are integral to shaping the future.
                                By exploring the synergy between these fields, I
                                hope to highlight their
                                combined potential to drive innovation and solve
                                complex challenges.
                                Furthermore, I hope to share my experiences and
                                insights, inspiring others to
                                learn from my journey and athletic endeavors.
                                Enjoy!</p>
