        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>My name is Spencer Rose. I'm from Clearwater, Florida and a current
                student-athlete at Tufts University. At Tufts, I'm
                double-majoring in Computer
                Science (BS) and Economics (BA) and will graduate this upcoming
                Spring.
        <p></p>
        My interests include hockey and finance, both of which I am
        deeply passionate
        about. One goal of my website is to demonstrate how economics
        and computer
        science are integral to shaping the future. By exploring the
        synergy between
        these fields, I hope to highlight their combined potential to
        drive innovation
        and solve complex challenges. Furthermore, I hope to share my
        experiences and
        insights, inspiring others to learn from my journey and athletic
        endeavors.
        Enjoy!</p>
